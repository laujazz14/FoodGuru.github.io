      <h1>App Development Plan</h1>
      <li>The Food Guru team will use the AGILE software development methodology to 
        develop the application. Which allows the team to respond to the changing 
        requirements and market conditions. The following are the step-by-step description of 
        how the team will develop the application.
        First step is Planning, our team will gather to define the project goals and 
        requirements. Next is Designing where our team works on designing the application. 
        Where it needs to identify the features and functionalities. Next is Implementation, 
        where our team works on developing the application. Next is Testing and integration 
        where our team works to test the application to ensure that it meets the goals of the 
        project. Lastly is the Maintenance our team will maintain the application to ensure that 
        the application continues to function correctly and efficiently and effectively.
        </li>
      <h2>Information Architecture or Data Structure</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The user's personal information is essential to this application and is also one 
          of the data that will be collected. It includes, the name, age, gender, the height, weight, 
          and BMI of the user. Moreover, we should also collect information about nutrition 
          education in cardiovascular system. This information will be collected from the website 
          of the Department of Science and Technology. The user's personal information will be 
          collected base from the user's input from the form. All the scores and progress of the 
          users in the game will also be collected and will be the foundation to see if the users 
          have learned from the game.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Marketing and Scalability</h2>
      <li>The Food Guru will have 3 stages to market our app and generate users. The 
        three stages are <strong>Awareness, Acquisition, and Retention.</strong>
        We will create awareness as much as possible by building our ideal user persona. We 
        want to know what they do, where do they work, what knowledge do they have when 
        it comes to nutrition education, and how do they serve meals for their children. Also, 
        part of our awareness stage is competitor research, we will find potential competitors 
        and understand their product and marketing tactics and once we've understood our 
        competitors, we will be able to differentiate our app from our competitors and help us 
        develop our effective marketing plan which will make us unique from all our 
        competitors. Afterwards is the Acquisition Stage this stage the app is already on the 
        store, and we want to increase our app's discoverability and generate more 
        downloads. We are going to apply the <strong>Influencer Marketing</strong> on this Acquisition stage.
        The last stage of our marketing is the Retention stage. Our goal on this stage is to 
        hook up our users to our app and make them use it on a frequent basis. The specific 
        engagement that we are going to use on this stage is the <strong>Gamification</strong>.</li>

      <h2>Sustainability Plan</h2>
      <li>Our team will still sustain the app even after the FLExPHD competition by 
following our marketing and scalability goals. We'd still implement our acquisition and 
retention plans so that we'll have more users and installations in our app. We would 
also focus on developing a good Customer Service to sustain our app and its users. 
Providing a good customer support is the key to create awesome word of mouth and 
fewer negative reviews. Our team will be active on reading the comments and 
suggestions and we'll actively reply to solve the user's problems with the app. Through 
our active support team, our users will be more inclined to download and use the Food 
Guru app, we will make it easy for users to connect and share their feedback with our 
team. We’ll have a feedback button in our app which could connect with our chat 
support or email.</li>
