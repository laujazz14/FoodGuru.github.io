  <h2>Survey Overview</h2>
  <p1>The team surveyed through Google Forms to test the concept for the mobile application. The survey aims to gather information about the parents' knowledge in terms of nutrition and the status of their children's health. Through this survey, we will be provided a better understanding if there is a need for an application that can provide parents and their children knowledge about the nutritional values of food, food quality and safety, and food preparation.</p1>
  <p1>The survey has a total of 50 respondents. The survey was conducted from April 6 - 12, 2023.</p1>
  <br><br>
  <h2>Demographic Information</h2>
  <p1>The demographic section asked about the monthly income, age, and availability of devices.</p1>
  <br><br>
  <h3>Age Distribution of Participants</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Under 30 - 34 years old: 30%</li>
    <li>35 - 39 years old: 24%</li>
    <li>25 - 29 years old: 16%</li>
    <li>40 - 44 years old: 14%</li>
    <li>45 - 54 years old: 8%</li>
    <li>18 - 24 years old: 4%</li>
    <li>65 - 74 years old: 4%</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Participant Relationship Status</h3>
  <p1>Most surveyed participants were the household head, spouse, or partner. As seen in Figure 2, 40% were household heads, and 34% were spouses. The rest were the household head's son, brother, or parents. This is significant in our pretest since the household head is the decision maker. Additionally, most of the respondents were female.</p1>

  </div>
  <p1>Most respondents were from the lower middle class, followed by the upper middle income.
    This is significant for us to identify our target market.</p1>

  <h2>Anthropometric Data</h2>
  <p1>Anthropometric data were self-reported by the participant on themselves and their child. Age, gender identity, height, and weight were collected on the participant and their child. The height and weight provided by the participant were used to calculate BMI for their child by the researcher.</p1>
  <p1>They were also asked how many hours their children sit and watch TV, videos, or play on a screen device (ex., phone, television, tablet, computer, or laptop). The majority of the answers were 5 hours or more daily</p1>

  <h3>Children Age and Gender</h3>
  <p1>The children's age of the respondents was mainly from 2 to 5 years old, followed by 6-9 years old and 10-12 years old. Most of the children were female.</p1>

  <h3>Perception of Children's BMI</h3>
  <p1>The parents were tasked to input the weight and height of their children. They were also asked if they think their children's BMI is just right. However, the result showed that most of them got the wrong answer, and some couldn't identify if their child's weight was suitable for its height.</p1>

  <h2>Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire</h2>
  <p1>The parental general nutrition knowledge was also surveyed. All of them understand the importance of 
    balanced nutrition in the growth and development of children and the role of vitamins and minerals in 
    a child's diet. However, few were unaware of the recommended daily servings of fruits and vegetables
    for children. Also, most respondents don't know the recommended daily intake of protein, carbohydrates,
    and fats for children. Almost all respondents know the signs of malnutrition in children and how to 
    prevent it.</p1>

    <p1>Respondents were categorized into three equal groups depending on their final score: low (0-6 points), medium (7-12 points), or high (13-18 points). Most respondents have low scores, with 37 getting 0-6 points. The rest received a medium score. None of the participants qualified for a high score. The questionnaire was based on the General Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire.</p1>

      <p1>Lastly, the respondents were surveyed on how they would feel if there were additional
        education or resources regarding nutrition. Also, their awareness about planetary health diet.
        The results showed that most think they can benefit from additional education or resources.
        Most of the respondents don't have awareness about planetary health diets. Also, almost all
        respondents don't have a tool for teaching children about health and wellness. And all of
        them will be happy to use an application for health awareness.</p1>
        <br><br>
<table>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Yes</th>
      <th>No</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Do you feel confident in your knowledge of nutrition for children, or would you benefit from additional education or resources?</td>
      <td>36</td>
      <td>14</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>According to Harvard University, a planetary health diet is characterized by a variety of high-quality plant-based foods and low amounts of animal-based foods, refined grains, added sugars, and unhealthy fats and encourages food waste reduction. Do you know about planetary health diet?</td>
      <td>16</td>
      <td>34</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Do you have a tool for teaching your children about health and wellness?</td>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>44</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>If there is an available app for health awareness, are you going to use it?</td>
      <td>50</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <br>
  <p1>In conclusion, based on the survey, the possible target market of the application can be
    parents from the lower middle class. There is a lot of potentials for the application to use by
    children since most children use devices for more than 5 hours per day. Parents do not have
    a clear idea about BMI and lack knowledge about recommended daily servings of various
    foods for children. It can also be supported by low survey scores about knowledge of general
    recommendations from health experts, food groups and nutrients, and nutrition-related
    diseases and weight management. Furthermore, there is a need for an app for health
    awareness</p1>
    <h2>Pre-test for the Communication Material</h2>
    <p1>The same respondents were surveyed for the pre-test for the communication material. The
        communication materials were shown to the respondents. They evaluated the materials
        regarding the overall impression of the communication material, whether the message was
        clear and easy to understand, whether the material was visually appealing and easy to read,
        and whether they would like to share it with someone else. Each question will be evaluated
        from 1 to 5. 5 is the highest, and one is the lowest.
        As shown in Figure 6, for the overall impression, most respondents rated the material as
        very good, followed by excellent. Few think that the overall impression is just simply good.
        The visual appearance and intent to share with someone majority feel that it is excellent.
        Furthermore, the respondents also rated the clarity of the message as excellent.</p1>
